  About Me:
  
  Because of my insatiable need to not only learn but to be proficient at everything I have gained the ability to pick up almost any art form. Really anyone has this ability but many are of the belief that if they learn many disciplines they will only be mediocre at many things. And while there is some truth in this it lies only in the fact that we only have so much time to learn any one thing and more time equals higher proficiency in most matters. However, I have found that diverse learning can also accelerate our ability. Striving for several disciplines teaches us how to learn and learn quickly. Because of this methodology I have had the opportunity to learn  carpentry, metalworking, glasswork, painting, drawing, sculpting, robotics, programming and I am currently studying to get 4 different certificates from the adobe programs. There’s no real limits to what we can learn or how well we can learn them.
Some people frown on this practice, saying that the algorithms don’t focus on diversity. But I believe diversity is always a strength, in society, ability and in thought.

</p>
<p>

Goals:

My aim is to become extremely proficient in UX Design, Prop Design, and every artistically essential Adobe Program. With the goal of working on projects that I find meaningful and beneficial to society, and ultimately to seek a creative director position for a well-established company wherein I can make a larger impact on worldwide media.

  My process: 
</p>
<p>
  Often I find the best ideas come when we least expect them. To facilitate this I follow a tried and true method: 
</p>
<p>
  1) Identify – I start my identify the problem to be solved, or a question to be answered, and work to boil down to its true essence.  Ex: Someone needs a book cover for classical piece of literature such as ‘1984’ by George Orwell. They don’t just need a pretty cover, they need an idea that properly conveys not only the essence of the book but it’s appeal and reason for reading it. The question to be answered is, ‘How can we convey the most appealing message of this book to our selected demographic?’
</p>
<p>
  2) Idea mash/Mind mapping – Next I take time to answer the question in every possible fashion, getting every good and bad idea out into the open and then sifting through it all to find which pieces I think go best. 
</p>
<p>
  3) Be Bored – Studies have shown that the more bored we are the more creative we become. This is why you often find the perfect rebuttal to that argument you had yesterday while in the shower, or come get lost dreaming about a future vacation while mowing the lawn. So after I have gone through all my best ideas I take time to be bored, I go on a walk, a read electricians manual, I go for a drive. During I wait to get bored and let my mind wander. After which I immediately come back to my projects and look over my ideas once more to push them further and make connections I wouldn’t have otherwise.
</p>
<p>
  4) Sketches/Thumbnails – Next I take all my ideas and I start doing very quick and messy sketches, producing about 3 a minute until I have feel I’ve satisfied all viable routs, typically ending in about 50+ sketches. 
</p>
<p>
  5-10) Refine – I select my favorite Ideas and refine them, then I do that again and again, until I have one very polished thought, and well considered Idea.
